The main functionalities within the ATMSystem class have been encapsulated into 8 separate classes,
which are: Register, Login, Draw, Deposit, DeleteAccount, ChangePass, ATMOperationHandler, and TransferMoney.
This enhances the code's readability.
Nine Junit Tests have been added, which include: testRegister, testGetRandomCardId, testGetAccountByCardId,
testDeleteAccount, testUpdatePassword, testTransferMoney, testDrawMoney, testShowAccount, and testLogin.
The classes have been made protected, increasing the security of the code.
